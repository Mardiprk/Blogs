Paper explains the news.

We live in a world of too much information and too little context. Too much noise and too little insight. And so Paper's journalists candidly shepherd audiences through politics and policy, business and pop culture, food, science, and everything else that matters. You can find our work wherever you live on the internet — Facebook, YouTube, email, iTunes, Instagram, and more.

Paper was launched at Paper Media in 2014 by founders Ezra Klein, Melissa Bell, and Matthew Yglesias.
